# Eye Movement Animation

This project creates a simple HTML animation that simulates the movement of eyes following the cursor on the screen. It's a fun and interactive way to engage users and add a playful element to your website.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following files:

index.html: The main HTML file that defines the structure of the web page.
styles.css: A CSS file that provides styling for the eyes and their movements.
eyes.js: JavaScript code responsible for handling the eye movement animation.

## How to Run

To use this project, follow these steps:

Clone or download the project files to your local machine.
Open the index.html file in a web browser of your choice. You should see two eyes on the screen.
Move your mouse cursor within the browser window, and you'll notice that the eyes follow the cursor's movement.
Project Components

HTML (index.html)
The HTML file contains the basic structure of the web page. It includes the following key components:

<link> tag: This links the styles.css file to apply styling to the eyes.
<div class="eyes">: This is a container for the eyes. It uses CSS to center itself vertically and horizontally on the screen.
<div class="eye">: These are the eye elements. They are circular and white.
<div class="ball">: These represent the pupils of the eyes. They are black and move in response to mouse movement.
<script src="./eyes.js"></script>: This script tag includes the JavaScript file responsible for animating the eye movement.
CSS (styles.css)
The CSS file (styles.css) defines the visual appearance and positioning of the eyes and pupils. It includes styling for centering the eyes and making them look like a pair of cartoon eyes.

JavaScript (eyes.js)
The JavaScript file (eyes.js) contains the code that enables the eyes to follow the mouse cursor. It does this by calculating the cursor's position and updating the pupils' positions accordingly.

## Future Improvements

In the future, we plan to make the following improvements to this repository:

Enhanced Eye Animations: We aim to add more dynamic and realistic eye animations, such as blinking and winking.
User Configuration: We want to allow users to customize the eye and pupil colors, sizes, and other visual elements easily.
Browser Compatibility: We will work on ensuring that the animation functions correctly across various web browsers.

## Customization

You can customize this project in various ways:

Modify the colors, sizes, or shapes of the eyes and pupils by editing the CSS in styles.css.
Adjust the animation behavior in eyes.js, such as the speed or range of eye movement.
Add more HTML elements or additional animations to create a more complex interactive experience.
